# C++ Final Project
![scene2_1024x1024](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56323496/169605083-33034877-3208-417b-9735-87c5aed1afd7.png)

## Description
For my final project, I wrote a simple ray tracing program.
The program renders a scene consisting of various point-lights
and spheres. The resulting image is output to a .bmp file. The
code is written in standard C++ and doesn't use any third party
libraries.

This repository also contains some extra features added after finals.

## Compiling
You'll need to install premake5, which you can get [here](https://premake.github.io/). 
Once installed, you can use it to output the project files for your dev environment.
For example, in the project's root folder on Windows:
```
premake5 vs2019
```
This will output the necessary project files for Visual Studio 2019.
